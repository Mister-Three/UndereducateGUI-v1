# UndereducateGUI-v1
UndereducateGUI is a feature filled plugin to view everyone online in a GUI

### Modules

As of the release these are the current things you can enable in the GUI<br>
`showPing, showHealth showBalance, showRank, showClient and showIfVanished`<br>
<br>
Each option has a description and the dependencies within the `config.yml`, please read through it or else the GUI will not launch.
<br>
<br>
I'm open to requests to show more modules within the GUI, just open an [issue](https://github.com/undereducated/UndereducateGUI-v1/issues/new/choose) with the Module Request label

### Configuration

Nearly everything within UndereducateGUI is configurable. This includes toggling modules, changing the prefix, lores and the messages. Check out the config [here](https://github.com/undereducated/UndereducateGUI-v1/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml).
